STATUS: cancelled
After I started writing this, the website http://forecast.io/ was created, which does almost exactly what I want. Forecast.io doesn’t show yesterday’s weather, but it’s good enough that I don’t feel the need to finish this program. Forecast.io supports emergency weather warnings, which would be hard to implement in this program.

This will be a small website that displays the weather. It will only display information I almost always find useful – the weather for yesterday, today, and tomorrow. It will not display the forecast for the weather farther in the future than that.

To start, I’m trying to write a command-line tool that reads the appropriate weather information (with some hard-coded inputs) through an API and then prints out the information I want to the command line.
