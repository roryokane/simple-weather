This will be a small website that displays the weather. It will only display information I almost always find useful – the weather for yesterday, today, and tomorrow. It will not display the forecast for the weather farther in the future than that.

To start, I’m trying to write a command-line tool that reads the appropriate weather information (with some hard-coded inputs) through an API and then prints out the information I want to the command line.
